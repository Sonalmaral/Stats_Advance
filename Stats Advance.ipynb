What is a random variable in probability theory?\n",">> A random variable is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon. It maps outcomes of a probability experiment to numbers.\n","\n","2. What are the types of random variables?\n",">> Discrete Random Variable: Takes countable values (e.g., number of heads in 3 coin tosses).\n","Continuous Random Variable: Takes any value within a given range (e.g., height, weight, time).\n","\n","3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",">> Discrete distributions describe random variables with specific, countable outcomes.\n","Continuous distributions describe variables with infinite possible values within a range.\n","\n","4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",">> For discrete variables, PDF (also called PMF - Probability Mass Function) gives the probability of each possible value.\n","\n","For continuous variables, PDF is a function whose area under the curve gives the probability over an interval.\n","\n","5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",">> CDF gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value.\n","\n","PDF/PMF gives the probability of a specific value (discrete) or density at a point (continuous).\n","\n","6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n",">> A discrete uniform distribution assigns equal probability to all outcomes in a finite set.\n","E.g., Rolling a fair 6-sided die: P(1) = P(2) = ... = P(6) = 1/6.\n","\n","7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n",">> Only two outcomes: Success (1) or Failure (0).\n","\n","Parameter: p (probability of success).\n","\n","Mean = p, Variance = p(1 - p).\n","\n","8. What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?\n",">> Describes the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials.\n","\n","Parameters: n (trials), p (success probability).\n","\n","Used in scenarios like flipping coins, defect rates, etc.\n","\n","9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",">> Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n","\n","Used when events happen independently and at a constant average rate (λ).\n","\n","Examples: Number of calls per hour, accidents per day.\n","\n","10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n",">> A distribution where all values in a given range are equally likely.\n","\n","PDF is constant over the interval [a, b]:\n","f(x)= 1/ b−a\n","​\n","  for\n","𝑎 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑏\n","\n","11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?\n",">> Bell-shaped, symmetric about the mean.\n","\n","Defined by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).\n","\n","Mean = Median = Mode.\n","\n","12. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n",">> A normal distribution with μ = 0 and σ = 1.\n","\n","Used to standardize data and compute Z-scores for comparisons and hypothesis testing.\n","\n","13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n",">> CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution.\n","Importance: Allows use of normal-based methods even when the original data isn’t normal.\n","\n","14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n",">> It justifies using the normal distribution to approximate the distribution of the sample mean when the sample size is large (usually n ≥ 30).\n","\n","15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?\n",">> Z-statistics measure how far a sample statistic is from the population mean in standard deviations. It helps test hypotheses about means when population variance is known.\n","\n","16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?\n","\n",">> It represents how many standard deviations a value (X) is from the mean (μ).\n","\n","Z= X−μ /σ\n","\n","17. What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?\n",">> Point Estimate: Single value estimate of a parameter (e.g., sample mean).\n","\n","Interval Estimate: A range of values (confidence interval) within which the parameter is expected to lie.\n","\n","18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n",">> They provide a range of plausible values for a population parameter and convey the uncertainty in the estimate.\n","\n","19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?\n",">> Z-scores determine the margin of error for confidence intervals. For example, for 95% confidence, Z ≈ 1.96.\n","\n","20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n",">> By converting raw scores to Z-scores, you can compare values from different normal distributions on a common scale.\n","\n","21. What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?\n",">> Sample size is sufficiently large (n ≥ 30 recommended).\n","\n","Observations are independent.\n","\n","Finite variance in the population.\n","\n","22. What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?\n",">> The expected value is the average or mean outcome of a random variable over many trials.\n","\n","E(X)=∑[x⋅P(x)](discrete)orE(X)=∫xf(x)dx(continuous)\n","\n","23. How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?\n",">> A probability distribution defines the likelihood of each outcome, and the expected value is the weighted average of these outcomes.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"sZaAWu4a5wt0"}}]}
